# Methane Flux Data Explorer

Welcome to the **Methane Flux Data Explorer** repository! This project combines powerful datasets, user-friendly design, and interactive tools to enable anyone to explore the dynamics of methane fluxes.

## Running Instance of the Shiny App

You can access the deployed Shiny app at the following link:
[The Methane Flux Data Explorer](https://lyreshka.shinyapps.io/MethaneFluxDataExplorer/)

## For the newest version (Assignemnt B4):

1. Visit the **updated** [Methane Flux Data Explorer](https://lyreshka.shinyapps.io/MethaneFluxExplorer/).
2. Select a dataset and choose your desired visualizations or filters.
3. Explore methane flux trends, analyze ecosystem variations, and export insights.

## New Features

- üìä **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - Line and scatter plots for temporal trends.
  - Boxplots summarizing CH‚ÇÑ flux by vegetation or ecosystem type.
  - Temperature vs. CH‚ÇÑ scatter plots.
- üó∫Ô∏è **Dynamic Mapping**:
  - Visualize CH‚ÇÑ flux data points on an interactive Leaflet map.
  - Filter by dataset, date range, vegetation type, or flux range.
- üìÑ **Comprehensive Data Tables**:
  - Explore and filter methane datasets with sortable and searchable tables.
- üîç **Detailed Metadata**:
  - Gain insights into dataset sources and methodologies directly in the app.

## Open and Reproducible Science

All datasets are publicly accessible via PANGAEA and acknowledged with proper citations. The app processes these data through the `MethaneData` package, ensuring an open and reproducible workflow.

## How to Run the App Locally

To run this app locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have installed the necessary R packages (`shiny`, `leaflet`, `ggplot2`, `DT`, etc.).
3. Run the app using the `shiny::runApp()` function or by opening the `app.R` file in RStudio and clicking **Run App**.

## The `MethaneData` Package

The **MethaneData** package is a custom R package designed to facilitate the loading and processing of methane flux datasets used in this app. This package provides a streamlined way to load the datasets into your R environment, ensuring a consistent and reproducible workflow for methane data analysis.

### Features of the `MethaneData` Package

- Functions to load pre-processed datasets such as:
  - `load_soilchamber_1()` for high-resolution CH4 flux data.
  - `load_soilchamber_2()` for manual CH4 measurements.
  - `load_beringian_wetlands()` for CH4 flux data from Beringian coastal wetlands.
  - `load_annual_estimates()` for annual CH4 flux estimates from various wetland and upland ecosystems.
- Ensures data integrity by storing datasets in a standardized format within the package and thus no data downloading on your part!
  

### Installation

To install the **MethaneData** package from GitHub, use:

```R
remotes::install_github("Lyreshka/MethaneData")
```
