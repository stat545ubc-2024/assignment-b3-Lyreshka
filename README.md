# Methane Flux Data Explorer

Welcome to the **Methane Flux Data Explorer** repository! This project features an interactive Shiny app for visualizing and analyzing methane (CH4) flux data from various ecosystems.

## Running Instance of the Shiny App

You can access the deployed Shiny app at the following link:
[Explore the Methane Flux Data](https://lyreshka.shinyapps.io/MethaneFluxDataExplorer/)

## Description of the App

The Methane Flux Data Explorer allows users to:

- View methane flux data on an interactive map with color-coded markers.
- Filter data by date range, ecosystem type, vegetation cover, and CH4 concentration range.
- Explore trends over time using customizable plots.
- Inspect data tables and summaries for detailed analysis.
- Access descriptions and metadata for various methane flux datasets.

This app is designed to support environmental researchers, students, and enthusiasts interested in studying greenhouse gas dynamics across diverse ecosystems.

## Datasets Used and Acknowledgements

## Open and Reproducible Science

All datasets are publicly accessible via PANGAEA and acknowledged with proper citations. The app processes these data through the `MethaneData` package, ensuring an open and reproducible workflow.

## How to Run the App Locally

To run this app locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have installed the necessary R packages (`shiny`, `leaflet`, `ggplot2`, `DT`, etc.).
3. Run the app using the `shiny::runApp()` function or by opening the `app.R` file in RStudio and clicking **Run App**.

## Tagging a Release

To create a release for submission:

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on **Releases** > **Draft a new release**.
3. Enter a tag version (e.g., `v1.0`) and release title.
4. Write a brief description of the release.
5. Click **Publish release**.

Ensure that the repository is accessible to your instructors by setting it to public or adding them as collaborators.
